Yo released two albums on Pointy Records in the late 2000s, getting great reviews from Q (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; “This could be the start of something major”), Dazed & Confused (“A masterclass in storytelling”), Word (“Perfectly constructed lyricism”) and so on; he supported people like Scritti Politti, Joanna Newsom, Patrick Wolf and Her Space Holiday and was on the main stage evening bill of the Oxford Folk Festival… then he disappeared in a haze of drunken stupor in the criminal underworld of Mexico (OK, we made the last bit up). He is now completing a set of songs that will be released here on Eidola in some form or other (TBC). Keep your eyes and ears peeled, even if the doctor tells you that this may lead to blindness and deafness.

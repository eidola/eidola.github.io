Yo's new triple A-side is out today available exclusively from the [shop](http://shop.eidolarecords.co.uk/products/556798)

Fusing the ramshackle scuzz of Alex Chilton with Beach Boys vocal harmonies, "Miskatonic Valentine" and "I Can’t Wait to See Her Again" mark a departure from the lofi country of his earlier music, who mostly recorded live or in single takes. "We didn’t fuss over it. It turned out a bit trashy so I added more noise on top. It was fun."
